## 📌 Overview

This project is a **car resale price prediction** web application built using **Linear Regression** and deployed with **Flask**. Users can input vehicle details such as **brand**, **model**, **manufacturing year**, **fuel type**, and **kilometers driven** to estimate the resale value of a car in real time.

The frontend is crafted using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**, offering a smooth and responsive user experience on both desktop and mobile.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Real-time price prediction using a trained ML model  
- 🚘 Dropdown inputs for valid selection of car attributes  
- 🧼 Cleaned & preprocessed dataset for better accuracy  
- 📉 Trained using **Linear Regression** on structured car resale data  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly and responsive UI using **Bootstrap**  
- 🔁 Instant results displayed on the same page

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects input values (company, model, year, fuel type) and enters kilometers driven.
2. Inputs are passed to a **Flask backend** that loads the trained model.
3. Model returns the predicted car price.
4. Result is displayed clearly on the frontend.
