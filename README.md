Developed a car price prediction web application using Linear Regression, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The app allows users to estimate the resale value of a car by selecting key attributes such as company, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, and entering the number of kilometers driven.

The user interface features clean dropdown menus for input selection and a responsive layout built with Bootstrap, ensuring a smooth and accessible experience across devices. Once the user submits the details, the trained model predicts the carâ€™s price in real-time and displays the result clearly on the same page.

**Key highlights**:

Trained a Linear Regression model on a structured dataset of car resale listings

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Python for optimal model performance

Implemented dropdown selections for categorical inputs to ensure valid user entries

Built a Flask backend to connect user inputs to the model and return predictions instantly

Used Bootstrap to make the design responsive and mobile-friendly

**Tech stack**:

Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data handling and model training

Flask for backend integration and routing

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for frontend design and responsiveness

Pickle for model serialization and loading during runtime
